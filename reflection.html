                The first step I took before designing this website was to sketch out the wireframes.
                The wireframes helped to give me start-up ideas of how I wanted the webpages to look like. I thought about the structure of my website and what 
                information I should put in different pages following the rubric for this assignment. Then I decided to make sections that were going to hold the information in each blog post.
                My initial goal was to keep everything simple and easy to understand, also make the website easy to navigate. I used the feedback I received for the first website to make 
                this one better. From the layout of the web pages to the graphics, I downloaded universe images for the background, this is because they are not too busy like the images I used in the first website.
                I did not want to use color for the background because I felt like it was going to be boring. I then designed the Home page and and its layout, this was my startup point because its interface is the face of the website,
                and the user will engage with it to navigate through to other pages. I watched tutorials on YouTube by <a href="https://youtu.be/zAjDc1HPgYM?list=PL3pyLl-dgiqBSBsC5O5AQHN1UsUk-60nc">Awa Melvine</a> to help me add the footer
                and make the autoplay slider display for the blog posts.
               </p> 

               <span><i class="far fa-calendar"> 25-30 May, 2022</i></span>
               <p>
                On these days, I worked on the html files and CSS styling for the blog posts, I went for similar layouts for all the pages and decided to make the background image a dark universe with shooting stars. I went for this dark background
                because the color of the text is cream white so I did not want to use a busy background that would make the text difficult to read, since from the feedback I got, most of the test was blending in the background so I did not want that to happen this time
                around. I went back to read the critical writings and I realized I did not give much of my thoughts on some of the discussions, even the feedback stated that, so I reread the information on each post and added more of my thoughts to them. Adding the footer element 
                to all the pages was a major decision, and using java script to style the slider was quite an interesting experience. I put all the links to other pages in every page, because it gave accessibility to the user so they can be able to access any page they wanted at any given time. 
                I also designed the interfaces to have the same structure from top to bottom so that the user does not get confused as they browse from page to page.

                Most of the coding was just copy and paste from the first website, then I just added some touch ups to improve the website. I enjoyed working on this website and writing more critical reflections, 
                because with the first website I did not pay much attention to what other html coding elemets meant, like the nav element which I used to wrap some of my information in the pages. I found out that it is not used for
                that while designing this website, it is used to wrap the list of content and links to other pages. One of the major decisions I made also during these days were to change the layout of my profile page and the homepage, this is because 
                I felt like in the first website there was not much work done on making the interfaces attractive and easy to navigate.
               </p> 

               <span><i class="far fa-calendar"> 04-09 June, 2022</i></span>
               <p>
                During these last days before the assignment submission, I worked on the final touch ups, these included making sure that the layout could fit small screen sizes and working on spelling errors, I increased and decreased the font size were it was needed
                to cover the screen size. I realized that I did not annotate the wireframes to best demonstrate the website pages, so I went back to fix that so that the user could understand the idea behind each wireframe which lead to the design of the final website.
                Then I attached the files to my GitHub repository, I attached the files after the final design because I did not want to end up forgetting to push changes I made for the website. I also felt like it will save me a lot of work. 
               </p> 

               <p>
                   Overall the design process was not that difficult and I improved my website design the best way I could, the tips I got and the feedbacks were very helpful for this process because I knew this time what to do and what not to do. 
                   I am looking forward to learning more and improving my website designs. I failed to use a lot of JavaScript styling because I could not understand some of it methods, but I am working on that, by viewing as many tutorials as I can to best understand the coding.
